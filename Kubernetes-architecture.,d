🧭 Kubernetes Basics — Notes
📌 Why understand the basics?

Before setting up a Kubernetes cluster, it’s important to know the core components and terminology, so that:

common terms make sense

architecture is clear

commands feel intuitive

troubleshooting becomes easier

🧊 What is a Node?

A node is:

a physical or virtual machine

where Kubernetes is installed

a worker machine

where containers actually run

Historical note:

previously called minions

If a node fails, the applications running on it go down — so we need more than one node.

🧩 What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A cluster is:

a group of nodes working together

Benefits:

high availability (if one fails, others keep running)

load sharing

scalability
